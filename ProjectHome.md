### Introduction ###
DroidBox is developed to offer dynamic analysis of Android applications. The following information is shown in the results, generated when analysis is ended:

  * Hashes for the analyzed package
  * Incoming/outgoing network data
  * File read and write operations
  * Started services and loaded classes through DexClassLoader
  * Information leaks via the network, file and SMS
  * Circumvented permissions
  * Cryptography operations performed using Android API
  * Listing broadcast receivers
  * Sent SMS and phone calls

Additionally, two images are generated visualizing the behavior of the package. One showing the temporal order of the operations and the other one being a treemap that can be used to check similarity between analyzed packages.

### Deploying release candidate ###
This is a guide to get DroidBox running. The release has only been
tested on Linux and Mac OS. If you do not have the Android SDK, download it from http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html. The following libraries are required: <a href='http://www.scipy.org/PyLab'>pylab</a> and <a href='http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/'>matplotlib</a> to provide visualization of the analysis result.

1. Export the path for the SDK tools

```
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/android-sdk/tools/
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/android-sdk/platform-tools/
```

2. Download necessary files and uncompress it anywhere
```
wget http://droidbox.googlecode.com/files/DroidBox411RC.tar.gz
```

3. Setup a new AVD targeting Android 4.1.2 and choose Nexus 4 as device as well as ARM as CPU type by running:
```
android 
```

4. Start the emulator with the new AVD:
```
./startemu.sh <AVD name>
```

5. When emulator has booted up, start analyzing samples (please use the absolute path to the apk):
```
./droidbox.sh <file.apk> <duration in secs (optional)> 
```

The analysis is currently not automated except for installing and starting packages. Ending the analysis is simply done by pressing Ctrl-C. A package will also be implemented soon to populate the emulator with data prior to performing analysis.
